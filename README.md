# Design Paterns
### This is Repository Lists of the design patterns created in this git

Design patterns are typical/repeatebale solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design. \
Each pattern is like a template that can be customized to solve a particular type of problem in a code.

It can be catagolized in three sections.\
The design patterns thar are exampled in this repo:

## Structural patterns
This design pattern explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, along with keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- [**Decorator**](https://github.com/NazemMahmud/decorator-pattern) -  Attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.


## Behavioral patterns
This type of patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
-  [**Strategy**](https://github.com/NazemMahmud/strategy-pattern) - Define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
